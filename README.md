# Object-detection-using-Yolo-v8-and-deep-learning
This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLOv8 to identify and localize 20 common objects in images and video streams. The system draws bounding boxes with confidence scores and evaluates performance using Precision, Recall, F1-score, and mAP metrics.
